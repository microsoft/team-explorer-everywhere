	<h1>Microsoft&reg; Team Foundation Server Software Development Kit for Java</h1> 

	<h2>Overview</h2>

	<p>The TFS SDK for Java package contains documentation, samples, and
		redistributable files that help you extend Team Explorer Everywhere
		clients and access Team Foundation features from Java applications.
		The SDK for Java requires Java 6 or later.</p>

	<p>
		<em>There are multiple ways to develop software with this SDK.
			Decide which scenario below best fits your situation and read the
			corresponding section below.</em>
	</p>

	<h4>
		<a href="#clientObjectModel">Scenario 1: Client Object Model</a>
	</h4>

	<p>You want to access Team Foundation features from a Java
		application where Team Explorer Everywhere is not
		installed.</p>

	<p>In this scenario you add the redistributable JAR and native
		libraries to your application, then use classes in the client object
		model to interact with a Team Foundation Server. High-level classes
		locate services, perform authentication, and expose version control,
		work item, and build features to your application. You can customize
		the behavior of some of the client object model classes.</p>

	<h4>
		<a href="#extendingPlugin">Scenario 2: Extending Team Explorer Everywhere</a>
	</h4>

	<p>You want to use Eclipse extension points and other APIs to
		extend Team Explorer Everywhere or use some of its
		features in your own Eclipse-based application.</p>

	<h4>
		<a href="#customPolicy">Scenario 3: Developing a Custom Check-in
			Policy</a>
	</h4>

	<p>You want to enforce custom rules before files are checked into
		Team Foundation Server from Team Explorer Everywhere
		or the Team Explorer Everywhere Cross-platform Command-line
		Client.</p>

	<h2 id="clientObjectModel">Scenario 1: Client Object Model</h2>

	<p>This scenario applies when developing an application that uses
		Team Foundation features but does not run in the Eclipse environment.
		The SDK for Java client object model offers features
		similar to the Team Foundation client object model for .NET and Visual
		Studio.</p>

	<p>Client object model classes do not provide graphical interfaces
		to Team Foundation features. They do not depend on packages such as
		Swing or SWT/Eclipse, but may be used safely in programs that use
		them.</p>

	<p></p>

	<h3>Getting Started</h3>

	<p>The client object model is packaged as one JAR file and a
		collection of native code libraries. The native libraries are required
		by the client object model classes to perform tasks such as single
		sign-on authentication, filesystem attribute modification, console
		measurement, and reading information from the process's environment.</p>

	<p>Follow these steps to get started using the client object model:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Copy the <span class="path">redist/lib/com.microsoft.tfs.sdk-14.134.0.jar</span>
			file and <span class="path">redist/native</span> directory (including
			all subdirectories and files) to your application's development or
			runtime location.</li>

		<li>Configure your application's Java classpath to include the <span
			class="path">com.microsoft.tfs.sdk-14.134.0.jar</span> file.</li>

		<li>Use classes from the client object model in your application.
			Sample client application source code can be found in the <a
			class="path" href="samples">samples</a> directory in the SDK. Class
			documentation can be found in the <a class="path"
			href="docs/javadoc/index.html">docs/javadoc</a> directory.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Snippets Sample</h3>

	<p>
		The <span class="path">com.microsoft.tfs.sdk.samples.snippets</span>
		project in the <span class="path">samples</span> directory contains
		source code for several sample programs that each perform a basic task
		with the client object model.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can import this project into the Eclipse IDE or build it manually
		with Apache Ant using the <span class="path">build.xml</span> file.
		See the <span class="path">readme.txt</span> file in the sample
		project for manual build instructions.
	</p>

	<h3>Console Sample</h3>

	<p>
		The <span class="path">com.microsoft.tfs.sdk.samples.console</span>
		project in the <span class="path">samples</span> directory contains
		source code for several applications that use the client object model
		in advanced ways. Read these samples to learn about topics such as:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Connecting to Team Foundation Server (authentication, HTTP proxies, 
			etc.)</li>
		<li>Customizing the persistence mechanisms used by the object
			model</li>
		<li>Logging</li>
		<li>Handling client object model events</li>
		<li>Specifying the Locale and TimeZone the client object model
			uses</li>
		<li>Changing the User-Agent HTTP header sent to Team Foundation
			Server</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		You can import this project into the Eclipse IDE or build it manually
		with Apache Ant using the <span class="path">build.xml</span> file.
		See the <span class="path">readme.txt</span> file in the sample
		project for manual build instructions.
	</p>

	<h2 id="extendingPlugin">Scenario 2: Extending Team Explorer
		Everywhere Plug-in for Eclipse</h2>

	<p>Extending the plug-in for Eclipse is done with Eclipse extension
		points. Use Eclipse's plug-in artifact discovery features to find
		public extension points in the Team Explorer Everywhere plug-ins.
		Client object model classes and features are available in this
		scenario because the packages are re-exported from the Team Explorer
		Everywhere plug-ins. Customization of the connection process through
		the client object model is not supported because the plug-in for
		Eclipse requires specific connection behavior.</p>

	<h3>Work Item Control Sample</h3>

	<p>
		The <span class="path">com.microsoft.tfs.sdk.samples.witcontrols</span>
		project in the <span class="path">samples</span> directory adds custom
		work item control types to the Team Explorer Everywhere work item
		editor.
	</p>
	<p>
		Import this project into the Eclipse IDE where the Team Explorer
		Everywhere plug-in for Eclipse is installed. See the <span
			class="path">readme.html</span> file in the sample project for help
		using this sample.
	</p>

	<h2 id="customPolicy">Scenario 3: Developing a Custom Check-in
		Policy</h2>

	<p>You can write custom check-in policies in Java and deploy them
		where Team Explorer Everywhere clients are installed.</p>

	<h3>Cusotm Check-in Policy Sample</h3>

	<p>
		The <span class="path">com.microsoft.tfs.sdk.samples.checkinpolicy</span>
		project in the <span class="path">samples</span> directory is an
		implementation of a custom check-in policy that works with both the
		graphical Team Explorer Everywhere and with the
		non-graphical Cross-platform Command-line Client programs.
	</p>
	<p>
		Import this project into the Eclipse IDE where the Team Explorer
		Everywhere plug-in for Eclipse is installed. See the <span
			class="path">readme.html</span> file in the sample project for help
		using this sample.
	</p>

	<h2 id="samplesInEclipse">Building Samples with Eclipse</h2>

	<p>Sample projects which are not Eclipse plug-in projects require
		manual configuration before they will build and run in Eclipse. If one
		of the samples you imported into your workspace does not build or run,
		follow the steps in this section.</p>

	<h3>Java Build Path</h3>

	<p>Some samples cannot be compiled until the redistributable JAR is
		added to the project's build path. To add the JAR to the build path:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Right click on the sample project in the Package Explorer or
			Project Explorer view and choose Build Path &gt; Configure Build
			Path...</li>
		<li>When the Properties dialog containing the Java Build Path
			page appears, click the Libraries tab then click the Add External
			JARs... button</li>
		<li>Browse to the SDK's <span class="path">redist/lib/com.microsoft.tfs.sdk-14.134.0.jar</span>
			file and click Open</li>
		<li>Click OK to close the Properties dialog</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The sample project should now compile without errors.</p>

	<h3>Native Libraries</h3>

	<p>To debug and run sample projects which are not plug-in projects,
		you must edit your debug or run configuration to set the system
		property the native library loader users. If you do not know how to
		create and edit debug or run configurations, refer to the Eclipse
		documentation. To set the system property:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Edit an existing debug or run configuration</li>
		<li>In the Debug Configurations or Run Configurations dialog,
			select your configuration on the left, then click the Arguments tab</li>
		<li>In the VM arguments text box add add the Java system property
			argument (see <a href="#nativenotes">Notes on Native Libraries</a>
			for how to determine this value)</li>
		<li>Click Apply to save the configuration changes</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Now the native libraries can be loaded by the client object
		model when you debug or run your application.</p>
